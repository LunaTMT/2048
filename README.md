### Personal Overview

Fortunately, this project was fairly easy to accomplish. However, attempting to add sliding animations proved too difficult. I reached a point where I felt that my whole code stucture would have to be altered to achieve the desired result. In short, It seemed to me that I would need to rewrite everything.

Instead of getting overly frustrated by attempting this, I think it's probably better that I set this aside, focus on building new projects and come back to it. Most likely the knowledge I will gain from building new projects will give me the requisite knowledge to remake this game much more efficiently and with the animations.

#### Future Projects

1. ~~Doodle Jump~~
2. Tetris
3. Bubbleshooter
4. Pacman
5. Connect Four
6. Asteroids
7. Flappy Birds
8. Tron (This would be a good networking project)
9. Conwayâ€™s Game of Life
10. Typing - Destroy the letters that come down the screen by typing
